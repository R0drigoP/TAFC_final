# Optimizing Molecular Structure Using Genetic Algorithms

This was part of a group project for the course "Advanced Topics of Computational Physics". The goal was to find the optimal structure of a cluster such that the Lennard-Jones potential would be minimum, while calculating the potential the few times
possible and using Genetic Algorithms. The class molecule was created, with methods responsible for processes such as mating or mutation. The main.cpp function can obtain the global minima very well for clusters with sizes between 3 and 25, however 
for larger system sizes it becomes more and more challenging to perform such tasks, and external optimizing methods are required. For more information on how to run the program, refer to the .txt file explaining the procedure.
